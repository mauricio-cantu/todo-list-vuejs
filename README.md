# Categorized Todo List with Vue.JS

## About
A Todo List App that allows the creation of categories and linking them to the Todo items. I developed this one to study some Vue functionalities and practice responsive design with flexbox. To get the app a Material Design lookalike I used the <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/">Vuetify</a> library.

The app is live on https://categorized-todo-list.netlify.app/.

## Next steps
There are some features and improvements I want to implement in order to learn other topics about Vue. For now, I've got the following ones in mind:
- [ ] Separate the items and categories logic, both in different components
- [ ] Start using Vuex to manage the application state
- [ ] Implement a real-time language changing
- [ ] Design a "light theme" and provide a theme switcher button
